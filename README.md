### **📈 Stock Market Price Prediction**

This project uses deep learning to predict the future stock prices of **Unilever Pakistan Foods** using historical stock data.

---

### **🗂 Dataset**

* **Source:** Public stock price history
* **Time Frame:** Jan 31, 2020 – Jul 28, 2025
* **Features:** Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Change %

---

### **🧠 Model Used**

* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

  * Specialized for sequential/time-series data
  * Captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends
  * Handles non-linear patterns in stock prices

---

### **📊 Model Performance**

* **RMSE:** 432.24 PKR
* **MAE:** 235.17 PKR
* **MAPE:** 1.03% (Low error rate)

---

### **⚙️ Why LSTM?**

* Models temporal dependencies in stock data
* Better at long-term forecasting than ARIMA
* Suitable for non-linear financial patterns

---

### **🛠 Alternative Models**

* **ARIMA** – For linear trends
* **GRU** – Faster, fewer gates
* **Transformers (e.g., Informer, Autoformer, FinBERT)** – For large-scale and multimodal inputs like stock + news

---

### **📈 Features That Improve Accuracy**

* Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, MA)
* Market sentiment (news/social media)
* Fundamental & macroeconomic data
* Temporal signals (weekday, month, holidays)
* Lagged stats and sector performance

---

### 📁 **Project Folder Includes**

* Code notebook
* Trained model files
* Instructions (`README.md`) for setup and execution
